## Dive Deeper into Bika.ai: How AI Automatically Completes Tasks?

After getting a quick start, you'll find that using Bika.ai is incredibly simple. Just select the appropriate AI template, and you can easily complete various tasks and make further adjustments.

Let's open the main UI and delve into Bika.ai to understand its core components and how it achieves automation.

<p align="center">
 <img src="Docs/static/space2.en.png" alt="space2.en" />
</p>

### Space

The space is the first interface you see when you enter Bika.ai. It encompasses all your work, consisting of personal areas, resource areas, exploration areas, display areas, personal settings, and space management.

<p align="center">
 <img src="Docs/static/space-structure2.en.png" alt="space-structure2.en" />
</p>


A space can have multiple members, each with their own personal zones and multiple resources.

### Personal Area

In the personal area, you can see your personal homepage, tasks, and reports. The homepage is an overview of your work, let's take a look at "My Tasks" and "Reports".

#### To-do

In Bika.ai, AI automatically generates tasks such as data collection, report reading, data entry, and approval of AI-generated drafts.

<p align="center">
 <img src="Docs/static/mission1.en.png" alt="mission1.en" />
</p>

Note, the "tasks" in Bika.ai are different from tasks in typical to-do software, where users manually create and complete tasks.

In Bika.ai, tasks are auto-generated by AI, which also auto-determines their completion. For example, in the "Daily Morning Meeting Template" (link), AI automatically generates tasks for each member, achieving fully automated task management. This method reduces manual operations and enhances efficiency.

#### Report

Report are generated based on set rules or data, automated by AI, similar to an email or article.

<p align="center">
 <img src="Docs/static/report2.en.png" alt="report2.en" />
</p>


### Resource Area

You will notice when installing templates that a template consists of multiple resources. For example, the 'Slack Channel Scheduled Notifications' template consists of one resource:

- Automated Process: Scheduled to do something.

<p align="center">
 <img src="Docs/static/template-detail1.en.png" alt="template-detail1.en" />
</p>

Additionally, resources can include databases (multidimensional tables), which can utilize AI automation for powerful data visualization.

### Explore Area

The explore area allows you to expand the possibilities with Bika, including template center, invite members, upgrades, customer service, and help & support. The template center offers a variety of AI automation templates that let you quickly solve work challenges.

<p align="center">
 <img src="Docs/static/explore-area.en.png" alt="explore-area.en" />
</p>

### Display Area

Here, you can display and edit your tasks, reports, and resource nodes, making it easy to understand and manage your work content.

<p align="center">
 <img src="Docs/static/display-area.en.png" alt="display-area.en" />
</p>


### Personal Settings

Click on the avatar in the lower left corner -> Personal Settings, you can see your personal information, account bindings and security, notification settings, login records, developer API, and referral rewards.

<p align="center">
 <img src="Docs/static/personal-setting.en.png" alt="personal-setting.en" />
</p>

### Space Management

Click on the space in the upper left corner -> gear icon, you can manage and set up the space, including space settings, invite members, member management, role management, third-party integrations, paid upgrades, usage & billing, and space audits.

<p align="center">

### Scheduled Notifications, Messages, Emails

Set specific times or trigger events to automatically send messages, emails, notifications, AI summaries, AI tasks, etc. For example, notifying people about daily morning meetings, daily reminders, daily reports, monthly data collections.

The Bika.ai team runs 3 SaaS platform products, over 30 deployments, millions of users, and tens of thousands of team customers, and we desperately need a more AI-automated tool to reduce our own repetitive work, which is why we developed Bika.ai in the first place. We hope our customers can use Bika.ai in a 'use and go' fashion - just get in, set it up, and then let the AI automate most of the work going forward.
