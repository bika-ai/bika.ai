    </a>
</p>

<br />

Let's open the main UI and delve into Bika.ai to understand its core components and how it achieves automation.

<p align="center">
 <img src="docs/static/space2.en.png" alt="Bika Space Diagram" />
</p>

### Space

The space is the first interface you see when you enter Bika.ai. It encompasses all your work, consisting of personal areas, resource areas, exploration areas, display areas, personal settings, and space management.

<p align="center">
 <img src="docs/static/space-structure2.en.png" alt="Bika Space Architecture" />
</p>

A space can have multiple members, each with their own personal zones and multiple resources.

### Personal Area

In the personal area, you can see your personal homepage, tasks, and reports. The homepage is an overview of your work, let's take a look at "My Tasks" and "Reports".

#### Mission

In Bika.ai, "Mission" is a AI automatically generates task mechanism. 

Mission is a hybrid of approval, task, request, review, alignment, and confirmation.

You can use mission for such as to-do task reminder, request other users do something, data collection, seeking your decisions, report review, workflow approval, and confirm AI-generated drafts.

<p align="center">
 <img src="docs/static/mission1.en.png" alt="Screenshot: Mission Interface" />
</p>

Note, the "mission" in Bika.ai are different from "tasks" in typical to-do software, where users manually create and complete tasks.

In Bika.ai, missions are usually generated by AI or Automation, which also auto-determines their completion. 

For example, in the scenario of "Daily Sales Report", the AI will automatically generate a mission for each sales member. 

Once the members submit the form and the data record verified by the AI, this mission will be automatically completed.

#### Report

"Report" is generated by AI or automation based on predefined rules or data records, similar to an email, article, or document.

<p align="center">
 <img src="docs/static/report2.en.png" alt="Screenshot: Report Interface" />
</p>

For example, as a sales manager, a daily customer report is automatically generated and submitted to you by AI, which is deeply integrated into the process but still obedient to your commands.

### Resource Area

You will notice when installing templates that a template consists of multiple resources. For example, the "AI Create X Tweets Automatically" template consists of two resources:

- Automation resources: Schedule Tweets

- Database resource: Tweet Content

<p align="center">
 <img src="docs/static/template-detail2.en.png" alt="Screenshot: X Tweets Template" />
</p>

### Explore Area

The explore area allows you to expand the possibilities with Bika, including template center, invite members, upgrades, customer service, and help & support. The template center offers a variety of AI automation templates that let you quickly solve work challenges.

<p align="center">
 <img src="docs/static/explore-area.en.png" alt="Explore Area - Template Center" />
</p>

### Display Area

Here, you can display and edit your tasks, reports, and resource nodes, making it easy to understand and manage your work content.

<p align="center">
 <img src="docs/static/display-area.en.png" alt="Display Area" />
</p>


### Personal Settings
